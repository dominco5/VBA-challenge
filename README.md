This is Dominic Cinco's Module 2 Challenge: VBA.

This VBA script will read through data for stocks, analyzing and creating two tables. One will be a summary table for each stock, including year change in dollars, percent change, and total volume. The other table will display the stock with greatest percent increase, greatest percent decrease, and greatest total volume. 

This script will also loop through all worksheets in a workbook, allowing analysis on separate years by running through the macro only once.
